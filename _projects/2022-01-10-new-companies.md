At Summit Advisors, we have a team specialized in the creation of new companies, whether through the various foreign investment processes or national-level companies. Our firm advises entrepreneurs from different nationalities and backgrounds who aim to establish themselves in Andorra and operate through corporate structures in various professional sectors. The combination of a favorable tax regime, economic stability, and a strategic location in Europe makes Andorra an ideal destination to establish and manage businesses of different kinds.

This service includes comprehensive advice to companies in the various stages of their creation: initial planning (corporate structure), statutory design and governance bodies, constitution before a notary, and consultancy regarding the daily development of their activities.

Broadly speaking, the service we offer encompasses the different steps involved in the process of creating a new company. In the case of foreign investment companies (where part of the capital is composed of non-resident individuals or legal entities), the process would be as detailed below:

1. Selection of the company name (name of the future company), corporate structure (SL, SLU, SA, etc.), and details of the corporate purpose.
2. Foreign investment application, which describes the activities to be undertaken, along with five-year projections related to investment, revenue, and employee hiring, among other things.
3. Pre-opening of a current account for the future company in a local bank to make the deposit of the share capital. For limited liability companies (SL & SLU), the minimum share capital must be 3,000 euros, and for public limited companies (SA), a minimum share capital of 60,000 euros applies.
4. Drafting of the company bylaws.
5. Constitution before a notary.
6. Registration with the Commercial Register.
7. Registration with the Department of Taxes and Borders (DTF - Tax Agency) and subsequent application for the Tax Registration Number (NRT).
8. Registration with the Andorran Social Security Fund (CASS).
9. Application and processing of a business license to begin commercial activities.
