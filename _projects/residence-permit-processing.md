Summit Advisors offers a comprehensive service for obtaining residence permits in the Principality of Andorra. Our team of professionals has extensive experience and is highly qualified to process the different types of residence permits before the Immigration Service of the Government of Andorra.

There are various types of residence permits; below, we detail the most relevant ones and their main requirements:

**Active Residences**

*1) Residence and self-employment permit:* This option is aimed at entrepreneurs and business owners who wish to establish their business in the country. It can be obtained through the creation of a company (foreign investment) or through the "liberal professional" option (intended for certain professions that have professional associations, such as architects, economists, psychologists, lawyers, etc.).

In summary, these would be the main requirements to obtain it:

* The interested person must reside in the country for at least 183 days during a calendar year.
* They must have a foreign investment authorization that permits the creation of an Andorran company in which they own more than 34% of the share capital or have the corresponding authorization for a regulated profession (in the case of applying as a "liberal professional").
* It is mandatory to be part of the board of directors (in the case of foreign investment - creation of a new company).
* A deposit of 50,000 EUR, non-interest-bearing, must be made at the AFA (Andorran Financial Authority).*
* They must have a rental contract or own a property in Andorra.
* They must engage in economic activity on behalf of the company (in the case of foreign investment - creation of a new company).
* Presentation of a criminal record certificate, both from the country of origin and from countries of residence.
* Certification of civil status (a sworn declaration can be signed in the case of being single).

\*In the case of establishing a company that promotes the digital economy, entrepreneurship, or innovation, no deposit with the Andorran Financial Authority is required. This deposit would also not apply if applying for a residence and self-employment permit through the "liberal professional" option.

*2) Residence and employment permit:* This option is aimed at individuals who have an employment contract with an Andorran company, simplifying the process in many aspects and being the responsibility of the contracting company.

In summary, these would be the main requirements to obtain it:

* They must have a work contract with a company established in Andorra.
* They must have a rental contract or own a property in Andorra.
* Presentation of a criminal record certificate, both from the country of origin and from countries of residence.
* Certification of civil status (a sworn declaration can be signed in the case of being single).

**Passive Residences**

This type of residence permit is intended for those who do not need to work but choose to live in the country. It is designed for specific profiles such as retirees, artists, elite athletes, or individuals with passive incomes (personal investments in financial assets, real estate, etc.).

Additionally, due to the different profiles it covers, there are several divisions, which are as follows:

1. Residence without lucrative activity.
2. Residence for professionals with international projection.
3. Residence for scientific, cultural, or sports-related interests.
4. Residence for admission to private geriatric centers or private medical or therapeutic care centers.

In summary, these would be the main requirements to obtain it in its primary division (Residence without lucrative activity):

* The interested person must reside in the country for at least 90 days during a calendar year.
* They must have private health insurance that covers illness, disability, and old age.
* They must have a rental contract or own a property in Andorra.
* Presentation of a criminal record certificate, both from the country of origin and from countries of residence.
* Certification of civil status (a sworn declaration can be signed in the case of being single).
* They must demonstrate an annual income greater than 300% of the current annual minimum wage.
* They must demonstrate a permanent and effective investment of at least 600,000 EUR in one of the categories defined by regulation (real estate located in the country, shares of Andorran companies, participation in Andorran investment funds, national public debt instruments, life insurance with Andorran entities, or non-interest-bearing deposits with the AFA).*
* A deposit of 47,500 EUR must be made at the AFA (Andorran Financial Authority), plus an additional 9,500 EUR for each family member to be reunited (demonstrating a higher level of financial solvency).

\*In the case of opting for real estate investment, the unit value of at least one of the properties must exceed 400,000 EUR.

It is important to note that these residence permits are administrative authorizations and do not, by themselves, grant tax residence to the holder. Tax residence is obtained by complying with a series of tax regulations specified in the countryâ€™s tax laws.
