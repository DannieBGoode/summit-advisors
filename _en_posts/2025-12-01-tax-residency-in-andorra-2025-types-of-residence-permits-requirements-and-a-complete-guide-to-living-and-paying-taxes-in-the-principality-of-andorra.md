#### **1. Living and Paying Taxes in Andorra in 2025**

Located between Spain and France, the Principality of Andorra combines the best of both worlds: mountain landscapes and European standards with its own transparent and competitive tax system.

The country, with just 468 km² and a population slightly above 88,000, offers one of the lowest tax burdens in Europe and a stable political environment.

In recent years, Andorra has transformed into a hub for financial, technological, and business services. Combined with modern infrastructure, full digital connectivity, and an exceptional natural environment, it has become an ideal destination for digital nomads, entrepreneurs, and passive-income residents seeking a balance between work and well-being.

#### **2. Why More and More People Are Choosing Andorra**

The profile of the new resident has evolved: it’s no longer limited to high-net-worth individuals. Today, freelancers, athletes, digital creators, investors, and business owners are also arriving.

Main reasons:

* Reduced and stable taxation: maximum rates of 10%.
* Institutional stability and very low crime rates.
* Open and international economy: agreements with the OECD and neighboring countries.
* Geographic proximity: 2 hours from Barcelona and Toulouse.
* High quality of life, nature, and efficient public services.

#### **3. What It Means to Have Tax Residency in Andorra**

Administrative residency is the immigration permit granted by the Andorran Government;

Tax residency is the status that determines where your worldwide income is taxed.

A person is considered a **tax resident** if they:

* Remain in Andorra for more than 183 days in a calendar year; or
* Have in Andorra their main economic and personal interests.

Additionally, unless proven otherwise, the taxpayer is presumed to be a tax resident in the country where their spouse (not legally separated) and minor children reside.

Meeting these criteria ensures that your income is taxed exclusively in Andorra under its legislation, avoiding international double taxation.

#### **4. Types of Residency in Andorra**

#### **4.1 Active Residency**

Designed for those who work or run a business in Andorra. It may be requested by an employee with a local employment contract or by a self-employed professional who establishes a company.

#### a) Active residency for self-employment

Ideal for entrepreneurs or professionals operating through an Andorran company. The applicant must own at least 34% of the company and act as its administrator. This permit allows the holder to work for their own company and is one of the most in-demand options.

#### b) Active residency for employment

For employees with a job offer in Andorra. The permit is processed through the hiring company. There are quotas by sector and skill level, and the employee must prove their qualifications and relevant experience.



### **4.2 Passive or Non-Lucrative Residency**

Designed for individuals who do not carry out local employment but have sufficient resources or passive income.

This is the preferred option for rentiers, retirees, and investors. It requires an investment in Andorran assets and staying at least 90 days per year in the country.

Sub-categories include:

* Residency for cultural, scientific, or sporting interest: for individuals of international recognition.
* Residency for professionals with international projection: quota-limited, allows 90 days of presence in Andorra and travel throughout the year.

#### **4.3 Digital Nomad Residency Permit**

Since 2024, Andorra offers a specific permit for professionals who work online without a fixed location. This authorization allows residents to live in Andorra while providing services to foreign clients, provided they meet:

* Sufficient financial means
* Valid healthcare insurance
* Minimum physical presence of 90 days/year
* Approval by the Ministry of Economy

The initial permit is granted for two years and can be renewed up to a maximum of ten. It is particularly attractive for digital entrepreneurs and freelancers who value Andorra’s safety and connectivity.

Andorra’s tax model is simple, competitive, and fully aligned with OECD standards. The country offers a tax framework that promotes investment and residency without compromising transparency or legal certainty.

* First 24.000.-eur → exempt
* 24,001.-eur to 40,000.-eur → 5%
