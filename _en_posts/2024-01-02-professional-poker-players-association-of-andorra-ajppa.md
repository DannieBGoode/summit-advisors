After months of work, the Professional Poker Players Association of Andorra - AJPPA is now a reality. 

Summit Advisors has been responsible for advising and carrying out all the necessary administrative and bureaucratic procedures so that the poker community in the country has a fully competent organization to fight for the interests of their profession and ensure its proper functioning.

This step signifies a significant consolidation and organization of the sector, confirming that the country has become one of the most attractive European destinations to reside in if you pursue poker as a livelihood.

The main objectives of its creation, detailed more extensively in the statutes, are as follows:

* Promote a smoother relationship with the public and private institutions of the country.
* Raise awareness of the collective and strive for better working conditions in the country through the recognition of the professional figure of the "professional poker player."
* Organize events related to the world of poker.
* Create a community where doubts and concerns regarding fiscal, tax, or legal matters associated with the profession can be addressed.
* Promote responsible gaming, as well as take actions to prevent potential issues of gambling addiction.

Having a professional association that represents their interests as a collective, providing skills and knowledge for their professional development, generating networks to share experiences, and offering special benefits to its members, instills great confidence in the player. It also provides another incentive for the country, making it more appealing for future residents to establish themselves there.

More and more professional players are choosing to reside in the Principality of Andorra due to its numerous fiscal advantages (earnings from this activity are taxed at 10% in their personal income tax, and there is no taxation on wealth), its extensive fiber coverage enabling fast and quality internet access, the possibility of accessing international online rooms (.com), proximity to Spain and France, the absence of a significant language barrier, and the security provided by its borders. Starting today, having a professional association will be added to the list of detailed advantages.
