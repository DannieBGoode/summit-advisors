At Summit Advisors, we are proud to announce the signing of a sponsorship agreement with MoraBanc Andorra, the leading basketball club in Andorra and a true sporting icon in our country. With this agreement, Summit Advisors strengthens its commitment to the values of sport, the promotion of local talent, and the international projection of Andorra as a destination of excellence.

**A sponsorship that goes beyond sports**

The partnership between Summit Advisors and MoraBanc Andorra was born from a desire to go beyond corporate visibility. For us, this sponsorship represents genuine support for sport as a tool for social cohesion, discipline, and shared effort — values we strongly believe in and that are also part of our corporate philosophy.

Furthermore, this collaboration allows us to connect with Andorran society, supporting a club with a rich history that represents Andorra both locally and internationally. We firmly believe that business growth and sporting success can go hand in hand, projecting a modern, dynamic image rooted in strong values, both within Andorra and beyond its borders.

**Why does Summit Advisors support MoraBanc Andorra?**

As a leading advisory firm in the Principality, Summit Advisors works every day to attract talent, investment, and strategic projects to Andorra. We share with MoraBanc Andorra the ambition to grow, compete at the highest level, and take Andorra’s name beyond its borders.

This sponsorship further reinforces our commitment to the country, enabling us to actively participate in a values-driven sports project that maintains a strong connection to the local community. Additionally, it opens up new opportunities to collaborate with companies and institutions that are also part of the club's support network, creating positive synergies for our clients and for Andorra’s business ecosystem.

**Another step in our social commitment**

Beyond our role as a tax, accounting, and legal advisory firm, Summit Advisors believes that the sustainable growth of any company must also involve giving back to the society that supports it. With this sponsorship, we reaffirm our commitment to Andorra’s social and sporting fabric, supporting talent, collective effort, and the positive values that sport embodies.
