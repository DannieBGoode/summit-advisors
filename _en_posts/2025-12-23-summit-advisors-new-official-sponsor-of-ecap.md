At Summit Advisors, we are pleased to announce the signing of a long-term sponsorship agreement with ECAP (Esquí Club Arinsal Pal), one of the leading ski clubs in the Principality of Andorra and a key organization in the training and development of young athletes. 

This agreement is entered into with a clear commitment to continuity, reflecting our firm belief in sport as a tool for personal development, social cohesion, and the transmission of values. It is conceived as a long-term partnership, built on trust and on the shared desire to actively contribute to the growth of a project that has a real impact on Andorran society. 

ECAP has a long-standing track record dedicated to the teaching and advancement of alpine skiing, supporting athletes from a very young age through to competitive levels. Its work goes far beyond technical training, playing a fundamental role in the education of children and young people through values such as discipline, effort, perseverance, personal development, and teamwork. 

The club carries out its activities at the Pal Arinsal ski resort, one of the most emblematic ski areas in the Principality of Andorra— a benchmark venue that forms part of the country’s sporting identity and helps project Andorra as a premier mountain and sports destination. 

For Summit Advisors, this sponsorship represents a tangible way to reaffirm our commitment to Andorran sport and its social dimension. Supporting organizations such as ECAP means contributing directly to collective well-being, the holistic development of new generations, and the strengthening of the country’s social and sporting fabric. 

We look to the future with enthusiasm and with the conviction that this collaboration will be solid, long-lasting, and enriching. We will continue to support projects that reflect long-term vision, social commitment, and excellence - values that define both ECAP and Summit Advisors.
