## Where is Andorra?

Andorra is a small, landlocked principality located in the eastern Pyrenees mountains, bordered to the south by Spain and to the north by France. Known for its ski resorts and status as a tax haven, it offers a unique mix of high mountains and narrow valleys.

The official language of Andorra is Catalan, although Spanish, Portuguese, and French are also commonly spoken due to its location and tourism industry. This multilingual environment reflects the country's diverse cultural influences.

In terms of accessibility, Andorra does not have its own airport. The nearest airports are in Spain and France. Barcelona El Prat Airport in Spain is approximately a 3-hour drive away, while Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in France is about 2.5 hours away. These proximities make Andorra relatively easy to access despite its mountainous terrain.

Politically, Andorra is not a member of the European Union (EU), but it uses the euro (â‚¬) as its currency under a monetary agreement with the EU. The country has a customs union with the EU and is treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.

This principality offers a unique combination of historical charm and modern amenities, set in the stunning landscape of the Pyrenees. It is a popular destination for both winter sports enthusiasts and those seeking a tranquil retreat in the mountains.
